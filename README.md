Exploratory space to create template for Spark Apps in production grade environments

An individual effort to produce templates for Spark Apps written for Scala and Python. Thereby annotate some day-to-day challenges not represented in books or documenation. This is a mashup of lot of code snippets and examples around the web and (mostly Scala books), attribution will be always honored.

In aim to avoid repetition, CI/CD configurations will be (hopefull) provided.
